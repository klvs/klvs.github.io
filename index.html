                    <h1>Does Facebook Know When We Sleep?</h1>
                    <p class="">Due to the aggressive nature of facebook's notifications and its notorious addictiveness, many of us wake up and check facebook and check it sometime before bed. Can we draw insights from this data beyond when our friends are online?</p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="">Facebook's Messenger app displays each of your friends' online state as online, idle, or offline. By mimicking the requests of from the facebook website, we can get this data too and track the online state of our friends. Creepy, right? </p>

                    <h2>Other Important Things</h2>
                    <p>While this is within facebook's terms of service, this sort of data can be abused and even be dangerous. The notion that you can track when your friends are online is both interesting and extremely creepy. While this is public data, privacy and anonymization are an important concern for this project.</p>
                    <p>The inspiration for this project is a passion and advocacy for online privacy. Features like "who's online" seem simple but can easily betray sensitive information to a determined individual. By diving deeper and giving meaning to this data I hope to raise awareness about privacy.</p>
